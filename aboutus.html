        <p>
            The Quackshack is a website created by five freshmen at Stevens Institute of Technlology in order to make finding popular movies in the current year easier.
            We provide all the basic information about these movies such as actor/actress information, movie ratings, and basic overviews of the films all in one place.
            Our goal is to make this process of finding good movies easy for anyone to use. Aside from showing what movies are performing well in general, its also possible
            to sort movies out by genre. This is meant to make finding specific movies easier.
            Our latest addition of the interactive quiz can be used to learn some interesting information about
            the latest movies and also some of the actors/actresses who are a part of these movies.
